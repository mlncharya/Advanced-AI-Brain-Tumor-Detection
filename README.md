# Advanced-AI-Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors using MRI brain scans. The model is trained on a dataset that includes both scans with tumors and those without. During training, the model is provided with a collection of brain images to learn how to distinguish between tumor-affected and normal scans. Various libraries are employed to improve the model's accuracy in identifying and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans.

To run this project, install the XAMPP control panel and SQLyog Enterprise software. Launch XAMPP and start the MySQL server. Then, open SQLyog Enterprise and connect it to the server.

Next, open the terminal and run the command python manage.py runserver to start the server. Use the generated link to register with your details. After logging in, choose the desired model and upload an image to analyze for the presence of a tumor.
